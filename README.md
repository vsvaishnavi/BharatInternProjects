# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website I created using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer. The website provides visitors with an overview of my background, skills, and the work I've done so far.

# Customization

- Feel free to customize this portfolio website to make it your own:

- Update the content in the HTML files to reflect your personal information, skills, and projects.

- Modify the CSS styles in the style.css file to match your preferred design and color scheme.

- Add or remove sections and pages as needed to showcase your unique skills and experiences.
